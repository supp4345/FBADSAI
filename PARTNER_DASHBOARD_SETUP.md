# 🎯 Shopify Partner Dashboard Setup Guide

## ✅ Installation Flow Fixed

The app now properly handles installation from Shopify Partner Dashboard without redirecting to the App Store.

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### 1. Partner Dashboard Installation
When you click "Test on development store" or "Install" from your Shopify Partner Dashboard:

```
Partner Dashboard → https://your-app.com/?shop=store.myshopify.com → OAuth → Embedded App
```

### 2. Installation Process
1. **Partner Dashboard Click**: Redirects to your app's root URL with shop parameter
2. **Root Route Handler**: Validates shop domain and initiates OAuth
3. **Shopify OAuth**: Merchant authorizes app permissions
4. **Account Creation**: App creates user record and stores tokens
5. **Embedded Launch**: App loads directly in Shopify admin

### 3. No App Store Required
- ✅ Works with unpublished apps
- ✅ Direct installation from Partner Dashboard
- ✅ No need to submit to App Store for testing
- ✅ Perfect for development and private apps

## 📋 Partner Dashboard Configuration

### App Settings
```
App URL: https://your-app-domain.com
Allowed redirection URLs:
- https://your-app-domain.com/auth/shopify/callback
- https://your-app-domain.com/auth/callback
```

### Required Scopes
```
- read_products
- write_products  
- read_orders
- write_orders
- read_customers
- read_customer_events
- write_script_tags
- read_script_tags
```

### App Distribution
- **Distribution**: Private app or Partner Dashboard only
- **Installation**: Direct from Partner Dashboard
- **Testing**: Use development stores

## 🚀 Testing the Installation

### Step 1: Access Partner Dashboard
1. Go to your Shopify Partner Dashboard
2. Navigate to your app
3. Click "Test on development store"

### Step 2: Select Development Store
1. Choose a development store
2. Click "Install app"

### Step 3: Verify Installation
1. App should redirect to OAuth flow
2. After authorization, loads embedded app
3. Shows onboarding flow for new users

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Invalid shop domain" Error
- **Cause**: Shop parameter missing or malformed
- **Solution**: Ensure Partner Dashboard is configured with correct app URL

#### 2. OAuth Loop
- **Cause**: Incorrect redirect URLs in Partner Dashboard
- **Solution**: Verify callback URLs match exactly

#### 3. Embedded App Not Loading
- **Cause**: Missing host parameter or CSP issues
- **Solution**: Check iframe security headers and host encoding

#### 4. Session Issues
- **Cause**: Cookie settings or session storage problems
- **Solution**: Verify session configuration and HTTPS setup

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify network requests in DevTools
3. Check server logs for OAuth flow
4. Validate shop parameter format
